A very basic soccer simulator written in Java with a GUI interface and the ability to play teams with different strategies from a jar file.

A team is created with a _Team_ class and one to several _Player_ classes. The compiled code can be packaged in a jar file and chosen through the main GUI.

A team consists of four players. Those players have a very limited amount of information available to them. Namely, their immediate surroundings and the direction of the ball. From this information they must choose their best course of action.
